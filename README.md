# FTL modding: names in text file to names.xml-type file
For use with FTL: Faster Than Light. This readme assumes you are familiar with what the names.xml file is all about.

Reads a text file full of names, one name per line, and converts it to the names.xml-type file that houses FTL's names (just one nameList though).

The text file can also have nameLists, the program will handle that, so in effect, will probably merge nameLists, but I've got a better program just for that: https://github.com/blizzarchon/FTL-Join-and-Sort-nameLists

***Additional Notes***

See 'sample' for an example input and output.

In sample, there's FTL's Kickstarter credits, which were pulled from the game files. The Kickstarter credits were the whole reason I created this program. If this is in any way bad, tell me, but I don't see how it would be, since you can find all the credits here anyway: http://www.mobygames.com/game/linux/ftl-faster-than-light/credits
