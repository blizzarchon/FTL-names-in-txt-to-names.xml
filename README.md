# FTL modding: names in text file to names.xml-type file
For use with FTL: Faster Than Light.

Reads a text file full of names, one name per line, and converts it to the names.xml-type file that houses FTL's names (just one nameList though).

The text file can also have nameLists, the program will handle that, so in effect, will probably merge nameLists, but I've got a better program just for that: https://github.com/blizzarchon/FTL-Join-and-Sort-nameLists

***Additional Notes***

See 'sample' for an example input and output.

FTL's credits were pulled from the game files. If this is in any way bad, tell me! I don't see how it's bad, since you can find all the credits here anyway: http://www.mobygames.com/game/linux/ftl-faster-than-light/credits
